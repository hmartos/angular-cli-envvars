# angular-cli-envvars (for Angular CLI V1.1.0)
This is an example repo to demo the approach to injecting environment variables into dynamically created environment files with the Angular CLI.

This repo is the subject of a response
to the article ["Angular CLI and OS Environment Variables"](https://medium.com/@natchiketa/angular-cli-and-os-environment-variables-4cfa3b849659) written by 
Sara Lara

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.

# Quickstart

* Clone the repo and `cd` into it
* `npm install`
* `npm start` to run the dev server
* `npm run build` to build the project

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

To build the project, export needed environment variables and then run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` 
directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
